    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <br>

    <h3><a href="builders.gg">builders.gg</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Active</strong> - builders.gg is a build discovery and breakdown tool for Destiny 2.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><a href="devtrackers.gg">devtrackers.gg</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Active</strong> - As a player of many live-service games I often found myself wanting to keep up to day with what the game developers were posting about future plans, game bugs etc. Every game has its own way of communicating to its players. I built devtrackers.gg to aggregate all these sources into one feed for every game.</p>

    <h3><a href="osrsvault.com">osrsvault.com</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Active</strong> - Tools for Old School Runescape</p>
    <br>

    <h3>stormshield.one</h3>
    <p><strong>Gone - Acquired 2018</strong> - A big fan of Fortnite when it launched, I built stormshield.one to help me analyse my gameplay and more effectively display information from ingame. At its peak, the site was serving millions of users per month. The site was acquired by ZAM Network in 2018 and shuttered a few months after I departed their team in 2019.</p>
